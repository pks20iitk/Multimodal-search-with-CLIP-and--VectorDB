In this notebook i demonstrate the multimodal search using CLIP which applied from scratch 
this multimodal search support all modality like test-to-text, text-to-image, image-to-text, image-to image search 
i craeted joint embedding of both text and image data furthe indexed this joint embedding in weaviate vector search and use 
Reranking for better and accurate search result
